# [M-01] Fee Calculation Bug Creates 7.76% Economic Discontinuity

## Impact

Medium. The fee calculation creates a significant price cliff that could be exploited for arbitrage.

## Description

The bonding curve implements a 3-phase fee structure with a linear decrease in phase 2. However, there's a major discontinuity at the phase 2-3 boundary (slots 250-251) where fees suddenly drop from 8.76% to 1%, creating a 7.76% cliff.

Here's the problematic code:

```rust
if slots_passed < 150 {
    // Phase 1: 99% fees
    sol_fee = bps_mul(9900, amount, 10_000).unwrap();
} else if slots_passed >= 150 && slots_passed <= 250 {
    // Phase 2: Linear decrease
    let fee_bps = (-8_300_000_i64)
        .checked_mul(slots_passed as i64)?
        .checked_add(2_162_600_000)?
        .checked_div(100_000)?;
    sol_fee = bps_mul(fee_bps as u64, amount, 10_000).unwrap();
} else {
    // Phase 3: 1% fees
    sol_fee = bps_mul(100, amount, 10_000).unwrap();
}
```

The issue is in the linear decrease formula's coefficients. Let's look at what happens around the transition:

```
Slot 248: 10.42% fee
Slot 249: 9.59% fee
Slot 250: 8.76% fee
Slot 251: 1.00% fee  <- Sudden drop
Slot 252: 1.00% fee
```

This creates a clear arbitrage opportunity at the phase boundary. A trader could:

1. Wait for slot 250
2. Prepare two transactions
3. Execute first tx at 8.76% fee
4. Submit second tx immediately when slot 251 starts at 1% fee
5. Profit from the 7.76% difference

## Root Cause

The coefficients in the linear decrease formula are wrong:

```rust
// Current formula
(-8_300_000 * slots_passed + 2_162_600_000) / 100_000
```

This formula should decrease from 99% at slot 150 to 1% at slot 250, but instead it only gets down to 8.76% before the hard switch to 1%.

## Fix

The coefficients need to be recalculated to hit exactly 1% at slot 250:

```rust
// Fix: New coefficients for proper linear decrease
let fee_bps = (-9_800_000_i64)
    .checked_mul(slots_passed as i64)?
    .checked_add(2_470_100_000)?
    .checked_div(100_000)?;
```
