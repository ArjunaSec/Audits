# [H-4] Users Can Drain Vault Funds via Malicious Token Program in `handle_jupiter_swap` Function

## Summary
In the `handle_jupiter_swap` function, the user-supplied `token_program` is not correctly validated. An attacker can provide their own token program, causing a CPI (Cross-Program Invocation) into their malicious custom token program and drain all funds from the vault.

## Vulnerability Details
The `handle_jupiter_swap` function is responsible for handling token swaps through the Jupiter DEX aggregator. The function transfers tokens from the vault token account to the receiver's `user_token_in_account`, creating an associated token account if it does not exist. However, the token program is not validated by the program, allowing users to pass their custom token program and invoke their malicious program instead of the legitimate token program, potentially draining all funds from the vault token account.

### Root Cause
The root cause is a missing validation check for the SPL token program. The program should verify that the provided token program is the legitimate SPL token program before proceeding with any token transfers.

```rust
// Missing validation
check_spl_token_program_account(token_program.key)?;
```

## Impact
- **Severity**: High
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Scope**: Protocol-wide

During the token transfer process, an attacker can supply their own malicious token program. This custom program can implement a transfer function that drains all funds from the vault token account to an attacker-controlled account, leading to significant financial losses for the protocol.

## Proof of Concept
1. Attacker creates a malicious token program that mimics the SPL token program interface
2. Attacker calls `handle_jupiter_swap` with their malicious token program
3. The function proceeds with the transfer without validating the token program
4. The malicious program executes, draining all funds from the vault to the attacker's account

## Recommended Mitigation
Add the following validation check at the beginning of the `handle_jupiter_swap` function:

```rust
check_spl_token_program_account(token_program.key)?;
```

This ensures that only the legitimate SPL token program can be used for token transfers, preventing potential fund drainage through malicious token programs.
