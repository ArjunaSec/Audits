# [H-14] Unauthorized Updates to Vault Status

## Summary
The `process_update_vault_status` function does not verify whether the admin account has signed the transaction. This oversight allows any user to update the vault status simply by providing the admin's public key.

## Finding Description
The `process_update_vault_status` function, located in `processor.rs`, is intended to update the status of a vault (active/inactive) and should only be executable by the admin. However, the function fails to check if the transaction is signed by the admin account. Instead, it only verifies that the provided admin account's public key matches the `admin` field in the `vault_params_data`. This enables any user to bypass the authorization check by providing the admin's public key, thus allowing unauthorized updates to the vault status.

## Affected Code
```rust
pub fn process_update_vault_status(
    program_id: &Pubkey,
    accounts: &[AccountInfo],
    is_active: bool,
) -> ProgramResult
```

## Impact
Unauthorized changes to the vault status can disrupt the system's functionality, such as enabling or disabling vault operations without the admin's consent. A malicious user could continuously update the vault status to serve their own interests.
