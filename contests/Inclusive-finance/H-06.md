[H-06] Unauthorized Token Account Usage in process_repay_funds Leading to Cross-Chain Exploitation

## Summary
In the `process_repay_funds` function, the `vault_token_out_account` parameter lacks proper validation, allowing malicious users to pass any token account as the vault's token account. This vulnerability enables cross-chain exploitation where users can falsely claim repayment of borrowed funds while redirecting tokens to their controlled accounts.

## Finding Description
The `process_repay_funds` function is a critical component handling the repayment of borrowed funds in the vault program. The function accepts a `vault_token_out_account` parameter but fails to validate:
1. The ownership of the account (should be owned by the vault)
2. The correct derivation of the associated token account
3. The authenticity of the account's relationship with the vault

This oversight allows users to pass any token account they control instead of the legitimate vault token account, effectively bypassing the repayment mechanism.

## Impact
**Severity: High**

The vulnerability leads to:
1. Direct loss of protocol funds through unauthorized token redirection
2. Cross-chain state inconsistency where other chains believe funds were repaid when they weren't
3. Potential cascading effects on other protocol operations that depend on accurate repayment status

### Technical Impact
- Malicious users can redirect repayment funds to their controlled accounts
- Cross-chain acknowledgments are sent with false repayment confirmations
- Protocol's accounting and state management become compromised
- Potential for double-spending or re-entrancy attacks in cross-chain scenarios


## Recommendation
Implement the following validations in the `process_repay_funds` function:

```rust
// 1. Validate account ownership
require!(
    vault_token_out_account_data.owner == *vault_params.key,
    VaultError::InvalidVaultTokenAccount
);

// 2. Verify correct associated token account derivation
let expected_vault_token_account = get_associated_token_address(vault_params.key, token_out.key);
require!(
    vault_token_out_account.key == &expected_vault_token_account,
    ProgramError::InvalidAccountData
);

// 3. Additional recommended checks
require!(
    vault_token_out_account_data.mint == token_out.key,
    VaultError::InvalidTokenMint
);
```
