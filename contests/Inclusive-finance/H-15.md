# [H-15] Missing Admin Authorization Check in Vault Admin Proposal Function

### Description
The `process_propose_new_admin` function allows any user to propose a new admin for the vault. However, it lacks a crucial authorization check, as the current validation relies solely on the vault structure itself.

**Missing Authorization Check:** While the function verifies that the caller is a signer, it fails to confirm that the caller is the current admin. The only check in place is:

```rust
require!(admin.is_signer, ProgramError::MissingRequiredSignature);
```

However, the critical check for admin validation is missing:

```rust
// Missing admin check
require!(admin.key == vault_params_data.admin, ProgramError::InvalidAuthority);
```

### Impact
This oversight leads to significant vulnerabilities, including:

- **Authorization Bypass:** Any user can propose themselves as the new admin.
- **Control over Vault Operations:** After a time lock, they may gain control of vault operations.
- **Management of Fund Transfers and Configuration:** They can control fund transfers and modify configurations.

### Recommendation
To address these vulnerabilities, it is essential to implement proper validation and proposal management. The following code should be added:

```rust
// Add authorization check
require!(
    *admin.key == vault_params_data.admin,
    ProgramError::InvalidAuthority,
    "Only the current admin can propose a new admin"
);
```
