# [H08] Theft of LST Tokens

## Description
The function `process_dln_send_acknowledgement` in `processor.rs` incorrectly checks the existence of the `receiver_token_account` by inspecting the lamports of the `associated_token_program`, which will always be greater than zero. This prevents the creation of `receiver_token_account` when it does not exist, causing transaction failures.

## Finding Details
The function contains the following faulty check, which incorrectly checks the balance of the `associated_token_program` instead of `receiver_token_account`:

```rust
if associated_token_program.lamports() == 0 { .. }
```

Since the associated token program is a program account, it will always have lamports > 0 (at least rent-exempt balance). This means the check will always fail, preventing the creation of `receiver_token_account` when it doesn't exist.

## Impact
### Transaction Failure When Receiver Token Account Does Not Exist
If the `receiver_token_account` does not exist, the program should create it. However, due to the faulty check, the program never attempts to create it (because the check always fails). This will lead to a transaction failure when attempting to transfer tokens because the account does not exist.

- If the receiver already has a token account, everything works fine
- If the receiver does not have a token account, the program fails, making it unusable for new receivers, causing Denial of Service (DoS) for new receivers
- This limits the usability of the program and creates an inconsistent user experience

## Likelihood
This issue will occur every time a receiver does not already have an associated token account. Since new users may not have an existing token account, this makes the issue highly likely in normal protocol usage. Any attempt to send funds to a fresh wallet without a pre-created associated token account will always fail.



## Recommendation
Modify the existence check to correctly verify `receiver_token_account` instead of `associated_token_program`:

```rust
// Correct check
if receiver_token_account.lamports() == 0 { .. }
```
