[H-10] Excessive native_drop value in LayerZero cross-chain messaging drains significant SOL

## Summary
The `native_drop` parameter in LayerZero cross-chain messaging functions is set to an extremely high value of 2,223,092,476,961,612 lamports (approximately 2,223,092.477 SOL). This value is significantly higher than LayerZero's recommended minimum of 1,500,000 lamports (0.0015 SOL) for Solana transactions, potentially causing severe financial losses and operational issues.

## Introduction
The protocol implements cross-chain messaging functionality using LayerZero for various operations including vault registration, fund transfers, and message forwarding. The `native_drop` parameter is used to specify the amount of native SOL to be airdropped to destination addresses before executing transaction logic. This parameter is critical for ensuring proper account initialization and transaction execution on the Solana network.

## Technical Details
The issue appears in multiple functions that utilize LayerZero messaging:
- `process_register_vault`
- `process_forward_pending_messages`
- `process_send_mock_ln_acknowledgement`
- `process_repay_funds`
- `process_transfer_funds_to_vault`

In each of these functions, the `native_drop` is hardcoded to 2,223,092,476,961,612 lamports, which is approximately 2,223,092.477 SOL. This value appears to be arbitrary and significantly exceeds LayerZero's recommended minimum of 1,500,000 lamports (0.0015 SOL) for Solana transactions.

## Vulnerability Details
```rust
match interop_provider {
    InteropProvider::LayerZero => {
        let native_drop = 2_223_092_476_961_612; // ~2.2M SOL
        let gas_limit = 1000000;
        send_lz_message(
            &vault_params_data,
            vault_params,
            signer,
            system_program,
            accounts_iter,
            encoded_message,
            vault_params_signer_seeds,
            native_drop,
            gas_limit,
        )?;
    }
    // ...
}
```

## Impact
Allocating such a large amount of SOL to the destination address can deplete the source account's funds, potentially hindering other operations or transactions.
The unexpected transfer of a large amount of SOL may cause operational issues, especially if the destination account is not designed to handle such funds.

## Recommended Mitigation
1. Set the `native_drop` value to LayerZero's recommended minimum:
```rust
let native_drop = 1_500_000; // 0.0015 SOL
```
