[H-05] `vault_params` PDA Bump Seed Canonicalization Vulnerability

## Summary
The `validate_vault_params_account` function in `utils.rs` incorrectly validates the PDA by using `Pubkey::create_program_address` instead of `Pubkey::find_program_address`. This allows an attacker to provide an arbitrary (non-canonical) bump seed, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data corruption.

## Finding Description
In Solana, Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) are generated using a combination of seeds and a bump seed. The canonical way to derive PDAs is using `Pubkey::find_program_address`, which:
1. Iterates through possible bump seeds (255 down to 0)
2. Returns the first valid PDA along with its corresponding bump seed
3. Ensures uniqueness and validity for given seeds and program ID

The vulnerable code uses `Pubkey::create_program_address` instead:

```rust
let seeds = &[VAULT_PARAMS_SEED, core::slice::from_ref(&bump)];
let seeds = seeds.as_ref();

let vault_params_key = Pubkey::create_program_address(seeds, program_id)
    .map_err(|_| ProgramError::InvalidSeeds)?;
require!(&vault_params_key == account.key, ProgramError::InvalidSeeds);
```

This implementation is vulnerable because:
1. It relies on an externally provided bump seed without validation
2. `create_program_address` doesn't verify bump seed validity
3. Multiple valid PDAs can be derived from the same seeds with different bump seeds
4. Attackers can supply a different bump seed that generates a valid but non-canonical PDA

### Technical Details
- The vulnerability stems from incorrect PDA validation methodology
- The program accepts any valid PDA without ensuring it's the canonical one
- This allows creation of multiple valid PDAs for the same seed combination
- The bump seed validation is completely bypassed
## Impact Explanation
- Malicious users can supply a different bump seed(non canonical) and gain access to functions intended for a specific PDA(real vault_param derived from canonical bump).
- In our program vault_params is used as authority in many functions which involve token transfers and crucial state updates, if attacker bypasses this validation he would be in charge and can transfer funds to any account(can make unauthorized transfers) or make updates to crucial states
- Most of the functions of our program depend on this function for validity of vault_params, and this functional itself is vulnerable, which eventually makes all of the depending functions vulnerable.

## Affected Functions
The vulnerability affects all functions that use `validate_vault_params_account` for authority validation:

1. Core Protocol Functions:
   - `process_register_oapp`
   - `process_register_vault`
   - `process_update_vault_status`

2. Fund Management:
   - `process_transfer_funds_to_vault`
   - `process_repay_funds`
   - `process_create_user_deposit_address`

3. Admin Operations:
   - `process_propose_new_admin`
   - `process_accept_new_admin`

4. Cross-Chain Operations:
   - `process_dln_send_acknowledgement`
   - `process_lz_receive`
   - `process_lz_init_nonce_and_setup_msg_lib`
   - `process_forward_pending_messages`
   - `process_add_hyperlane_remote_router`

## Recommendation
Replace `Pubkey::create_program_address` with `Pubkey::find_program_address` to ensure canonical PDA derivation:

```rust
let (vault_params_key, canonical_bump) = Pubkey::find_program_address(
    &[VAULT_PARAMS_SEED],
    program_id
);
require!(&vault_params_key == account.key, ProgramError::InvalidSeeds);
```
