# {H-11} Vault Params Account Garbage Collection Risk

## Summary
The function `handle_lst_stake` in `processor.rs` incorrectly uses the `vault_params` account to transfer lamports to the signer, risking the garbage collection of `vault_params`. This is critical because `vault_params` is used as an authority for other accounts, and its loss would break program functionality and potentially lock funds.

## Finding Description
The issue occurs in the `handle_lst_stake` function, where lamports are transferred from `vault_params` to the signer:

```rust
vault_params.try_borrow_mut_lamports()? -= amount_in;
signer.try_borrow_mut_lamports()? += amount_in;
```

The issue arises because the function does not use the correct escrow token account (`lst_escrow_token_acc`) for the transfer, as indicated by the comment in the code:

```rust
// transfer sol from escrow account to the signer since the stake pool expects the
// the signer to be owned by the system program.
```

This is incorrect because `vault_params` is a critical account used as an authority for other accounts (e.g., `vault_token_account`). If the lamports in `vault_params` fall below the rent-exempt minimum, the account could be garbage collected by the Solana runtime. This would have severe consequences for the program, especially since `vault_params` is used as an authority for other critical accounts like the `vault_token_account`.

## Impact

### 1. Loss of Authority
- The `vault_params` account is used as an authority for multiple accounts, such as the `vault_token_account`
- If this account is garbage collected, the program will lose access to the authority for these accounts
- Any future operations that require signing with `vault_params` (e.g., transferring tokens from the `vault_token_account`) will fail because the account no longer exists

### 2. Program Functionality Breaks
- The program relies on `vault_params` to manage funds and perform operations like transferring tokens and morel
- If `vault_params` is garbage collected, these operations will fail, rendering the program partially or completely non-functional
- Genuine users won't be able to perform these actions

### 3. Funds Locked in Accounts
- If `vault_params` is garbage collected, any accounts it owns or has authority over (e.g., `vault_token_account`) may become inaccessible
- Funds in these accounts could be permanently locked, as there would be no way to sign transactions to transfer or withdraw them
- This could lead to significant financial losses for users and the program

## Recommendation
The issue can be fixed by using the correct escrow token account (`lst_escrow_token_acc`) for the lamport transfer, as intended. Here's the corrected code:

```rust
// Transfer SOL from escrow account to the signer
lst_escrow_token_acc.try_borrow_mut_lamports()? -= amount_in;
signer.try_borrow_mut_lamports()? += amount_in;
```
