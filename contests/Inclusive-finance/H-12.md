# [H-12] Transfer of tokens to attacker controlled vault token account#99

## Summary
The `process_transfer_funds_to_vault` function in processor.rs does not validate that the vault_token_account is owned by the vault_params account, allowing an attacker to redirect funds to their own token account.

## Finding Description
The function `process_transfer_funds_to_vault` is responsible for transferring tokens from a user's token account to a vault's token account(vault_token_account). However, it fails to verify that the vault_token_account is owned by the vault_params account. and is a associated token account derived from vault_params and token_mint. The vault_token_account is assumed to be the correct account for the vault, but there is no validation to ensure it is actually owned or controlled by the vault_params account.

An attacker could:

1. Create their own token account.
2. Pass this malicious account as the `vault_token_account` in the transaction.
3. Redirect funds to their own account instead of the `vault_token_account`(original).

## Impact Explanation
A malicious user could pass a fake vault_token_account account that he controls, and redirect tokens to his own account instead of the original vault_token_account. since he is owner of this malicious vault_token_account, he is able to transfer tokens out of the account.

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, add validation to ensure that the vault_token_account is owned by the vault_params account and is the correct associated token account. Here's the updated code:

```rust
// Ensure vault_token_account is owned by vault_params
require!(
    vault_token_account.owner == vault_params.key,
    ProgramError::InvalidAccountOwner
);

// Ensure vault_token_account is the correct associated token account
let expected_vault_token_account = get_associated_token_address(vault_params.key, token_mint.key);
require!(
    vault_token_account.key == &expected_vault_token_account,
    ProgramError::InvalidAccountData
);
