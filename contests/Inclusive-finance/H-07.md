[H-07] Incorrect Token Account Existence Check Leading to DoS for New Users

## Summary
The `process_dln_send_acknowledgement` function in `processor.rs` contains a  bug where it incorrectly verifies the existence of the receiver's token account by checking the lamports of the Associated Token Program (ATP) instead of the receiver's token account. This causes a Denial of Service (DoS) for new users attempting to receive tokens.

## Vulnerability Details
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect account existence check in the token transfer logic:

```rust
if associated_token_program.lamports() == 0 { .. }
```

This check is fundamentally flawed because:
1. The Associated Token Program is a program account that always maintains a rent-exempt balance
2. The check should verify the existence of `receiver_token_account` instead
3. Due to this incorrect check, the program never attempts to create new token accounts for first-time receivers

## Impact
### High Severity
- **Denial of Service**: New users cannot receive tokens without pre-creating their token accounts
- **Broken Core Functionality**: The token transfer mechanism fails for legitimate use cases
- **User Experience Degradation**: Forces users to perform additional setup steps before receiving tokens
- **Economic Impact**: Could lead to failed transactions and lost gas fees for users

### Attack Scenario
1. Alice attempts to send tokens to Bob, a new user
2. Bob doesn't have an associated token account yet
3. The transaction fails because the program never creates Bob's token account
4. Alice's transaction fails and gas fees are lost
5. Bob cannot receive tokens until they manually create their token account


## Recommended Mitigation
Replace the incorrect check with the proper token account existence verification:

```rust
// Before (incorrect)
if associated_token_program.lamports() == 0 { .. }

// After (correct)
if receiver_token_account.lamports() == 0 { .. }
```

Additionally, consider implementing the following safeguards:
1. Add proper error handling for token account creation failures
2. Implement a retry mechanism for failed token transfers
3. Add clear error messages to guide users when token account creation is needed
4. Consider implementing a batch token account creation mechanism for new users
