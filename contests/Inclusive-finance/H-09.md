# [H-09] Attacker drains entire vault_token_account in his own token account by leveraging insecure CPI

## Summary
In the `handle_local_transfer` function, user-supplied token_program is not correctly validated. A user can provide their own token program causing CPI into their own malicious custom token_program and drain all the funds.

## Finding Description
The `handle_local_transfer` function is responsible for transferring tokens locally between accounts within the Solana blockchain. The function transfers tokens from vault token account to receiver's associated token account by also creating an associated token account if it does not exist. In `handle_local_transfer` function, the token program is not validated by the program which allows a user to pass their custom token program and invoke their malicious program instead of the legitimate token program.

### Vulnerable Code
```rust
let token_program_info = if *token_mint.owner == spl_token::ID {
    token_program
} else if *token_mint.owner == spl_token_2022::ID {
    token_2022_program
}
```

The check executes as follows:
1. If the mint owner is token program, "User supplied" token_program is stored in token_program_info
2. If the mint owner is token 2022 program, again "User supplied" token 2022 program is stored in token_program_info
3. If the owner is none of those, it returns error

The issue is that although the check is making sure the mint owner is the correct token program, it is eventually storing the user-supplied token program into token_program_info. A malicious user will pass a fake token program, this check will pass, allowing the user to invoke their malicious token program. This fake account could mimic the behavior of the real token program but execute malicious logic (e.g., draining the entire vault to an attacker-controlled account).

## Impact
An attacker can supply their own malicious fork of the SPL program as token_program. Their program would implement a transfer instruction that invokes the real SPL program but doesn't actually transfer the specified amount of tokens to the destination account. Instead, it drains the entire vault_token_account into an attacker-controlled wallet.


## Recommendation
Modify the check as given below:

```rust
let token_program_info = if *token_mint.owner == spl_token::ID {
    spl_token::ID
} else if *token_mint.owner == spl_token_2022::ID {
    spl_token_2022::ID
}
```

## Similar Instances
The following functions contain similar vulnerabilities:

1. **process_dln_send_acknowledgement**:
   ```rust
   let accounts_iter = &mut accounts.iter();
   let [dln_token_authority, vault_params, dln_token_account, receiver_account, receiver_token_account, token_mint, send_library_program, send_library_config, default_send_library_config, send_library_info, endpoint, nonce, event_authority, lz_endpoint_program, token_program, associated_token_program, system_program] =
       next_account_infos(accounts_iter)?;
   ```
   Impact: SPL token create_associated_token_account can be bricked.

2. **process_dln_send_acknowledgement**:
   ```rust
   let transfer_ix = spl_token::instruction::transfer(
       token_program.key,
       dln_token_account.key,
       receiver_token_account.key,
       dln_token_authority.key,
       &[dln_token_authority.key],
       transferred_amount,
   )?;
   ```
   Impact: CPI with same ctx into the function named transfer can be done.

3. **process_create_user_deposit_address**:
   ```rust
   invoke(
       &spl_token_2022::instruction::initialize_account3(
           token_program.key,
           token_account.key,
           token_mint.key,
           vault_params.key,
       )?,
       &[token_account.clone(), token_mint.clone()],
   )?;
   ```

4. **process_repay_funds**:
   ```rust
   if vault_token_out_account.lamports() == 0 {
       msg!("Creating token account for escrow");
       let ix = create_associated_token_account(
           signer.key,
           vault_params.key,
           token_out.key,
           token_program.key,
       );
   }
   ```

5. **handle_dln_swap**:
   ```rust
   let [escrow_token_account, dln_state, token_in, give_order_state, authorized_native_sender, maker_token_account, give_order_wallet, nonce_master, fee_ledger_wallet, system_program, token_program, associated_token_program, _dln_program_id] =
       next_account_infos(accounts_iter)?;
   ```

6. **handle_lst_stake**:
   ```rust
   let [stake_pool, stake_pool_withdraw_authority, reserve_stake_account, manager_fee_account, pool_mint, sol_deposit_authority, lst_escrow_token_acc, token_program, system_program, _associated_token_program, _spl_stake_pool_program_id] =
       crate::utils::next_account_infos(accounts_iter)?;
   ```

7. **handle_marginfi_deposit**:
   ```rust
   let ix = spl_token::instruction::initialize_mint2(
       token_program.key,
       receipt_token_mint.key,
       vault_params.key,
       Some(vault_params.key),
       token_mint_info.decimals,
   )
   ```

8. **handle_marginfi_withdraw**:
   ```rust
   let ix = spl_token::instruction::burn(
       token_program.key,
       receipt_token_account.key,
       receipt_token_mint.key,
       vault_params.key,
       &[vault_params.key],
