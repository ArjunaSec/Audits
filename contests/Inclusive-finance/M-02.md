[M-02] Data loss due to truncation of storage_account buffer


### Summary

Improper handling of account resizing in the `process_store_message` function in `processor.rs` can lead to unintended data loss when the `total_message_len` is smaller than the current `storage_account.data_len()`. 

### Finding Description

The issue arises during the execution of the line:

```rust
storage_account.realloc(total_message_len as usize, false)?;
```

If `total_message_len` is smaller than the current `storage_account.data_len()`, the account's data buffer will be shrunk, resulting in the truncation of any data that exceeds the new size. This behavior violates the security guarantee of data integrity, as critical data may be lost without proper checks. A malicious actor could exploit this vulnerability by providing a smaller `total_message_len` than the actual data length, leading to the loss of important previously stored data.

### Affected Function

```rust
pub fn process_store_message(
        program_id: &Pubkey,
        accounts: &[AccountInfo],
        message: Vec<u8>,
        total_message_len: u64,
        start_index: u64,
    ) -> ProgramResult { .. }
```

### Recommendation

To mitigate this issue, consider adding the following code:

```rust
if storage_account.data_len() < total_message_len as usize {
    msg!("Resizing storage account");
    let new_len = total_message_len as usize;
    let lamports = storage_account.lamports();
    let required_lamports = Rent::get()?.minimum_balance(new_len).max(1);
    
    if required_lamports > lamports {
        let diff = required_lamports - lamports;
        invoke(
            &system_instruction::transfer(signer.key, storage_account.key, diff),
            &[
                signer.clone(),
                storage_account.clone(),
                system_program.clone(),
            ],
        )?;
    }
} else if storage_account.data_len() > total_message_len as usize {
    msg!("Error: total_message_len is smaller than the current data length");
    return Err(ProgramError::InvalidArgument);
}

storage_account.realloc(total_message_len as usize, false)?;
```
