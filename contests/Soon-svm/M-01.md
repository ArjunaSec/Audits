# [M-1] Incorrect Account Funding Source in SPL Token Operations Leading to Transaction Failures

## Severity: Medium
**Impact**: High - Complete failure of core token operations
**Likelihood**: Medium - Will occur whenever these operations are attempted

## Description
The bridge program incorrectly attempts to use a Program Derived Address (PDA) `vault_account` as a funding source for creating SPL token accounts and performing transfers. This fundamentally violates Solana's security model since the System Program can only transfer lamports from accounts it owns.

## Technical Details
### Background
In Solana's security model:
- Only an account's owner program can modify its data or debit lamports
- The System Program can only debit lamports from accounts it owns (system-owned accounts)
- PDAs are owned by the program that derives them, not the System Program

### Vulnerable Code Analysis
1. PDA Derivation:
```rust
pub(crate) fn vault_pubkey_and_bump(program_id: &Pubkey) -> (Pubkey, u8) {
    Pubkey::find_program_address(&[VAULT_SEED], program_id)
}
```

The issue manifests in three critical operations:

1. SPL Token Mint Account Creation:
```rust
let instruction = create_account(
    vault_account.key,  // Critical: Invalid funding source
    spl_token_mint_account.key,
    rent.minimum_balance(Mint::LEN),
    Mint::LEN as u64,
    spl_token_program_account.key,
);
```

2. Associated Token Account Creation:
```rust
let instruction = create_associated_token_account_idempotent(
    vault_account.key,  // Critical: Invalid funding source
    depositor_account.key,
    spl_token_mint_account.key,
    spl_token_program_account.key,
);
```

3. ETH Transfer Operation:
```rust
let instruction = transfer(
    vault_account.key,  // Critical: Invalid funding source
    depositor_account.key, 
    transfer_value
);
```

## Impact
- All token-related operations will consistently fail
- Bridge functionality is completely broken
- Users cannot create token accounts or perform transfers
- No loss of funds due to transaction failures, but complete loss of service

## Root Cause
The root cause is a fundamental misunderstanding of Solana's account ownership model. The program attempts to use a PDA-owned account as a funding source for System Program operations, which is not permitted by Solana's security model.

## Recommendations
1. **Short-term Fix**:
   - Replace the `vault_account` funding source with a system-owned account
   - Use the program's upgrade authority's account or a dedicated system-owned account for funding operations

2. **Long-term Solutions**:
   - Implement a proper fee collection and management system
   - Create a dedicated system-owned treasury account for funding operations
   - Add proper checks to ensure funding accounts are system-owned before operations

Example fix for mint account creation:
```rust
// Use payer_account instead of vault_account
let instruction = create_account(
    payer_account.key,  // System-owned account
    spl_token_mint_account.key,
    rent.minimum_balance(Mint::LEN),
    Mint::LEN as u64,
    spl_token_program_account.key,
);
```
