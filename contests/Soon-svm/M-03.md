# [M-03] Loss of SPL Tokens Due to Integer Truncation in Bridge Program

## Summary
The bridge program's `deposit_erc20` function contains a critical integer truncation vulnerability when converting token amounts from `u128` to `u64`. This affects the cross-chain token bridging functionality between Soon(L2) and Optimism, potentially leading to significant loss of user funds.

## Vulnerability Details
When bridging ERC20 tokens, the program performs an unsafe numeric type conversion from `u128` to `u64` during the SPL token minting process:

```solidity
let instruction = mint_to(
    spl_token_program_account.key,
    spl_token_mint_account.key,
    depositor_associated_token_account.key,
    spl_token_owner_account.key,
    &[],
    amount as u64, // @audit Unsafe cast from u128 to u64
)?;
```

The vulnerability occurs because:
1. The initial amount is processed as `u128`
2. SPL token standard uses `u64` for amounts
3. The unchecked cast `amount as u64` silently truncates values larger than `u64::MAX`

## Impact
- Severity: Medium
- Users bridging large token amounts (> 2^64 - 1) will receive significantly fewer tokens than deposited
- Loss of funds is permanent and cannot be recovered without protocol intervention
- Affects high-value transactions and could be exploited by malicious users to steal tokens

## Proof of Concept
```rust
fn main() {
    let large_amount = 18446744073709551616u128;  // 2^64
    let truncated = large_amount as u64; 
    assert_eq!(truncated, 0);
    println!("Original large_amount (u128): {}", large_amount);
    println!("Truncated value (u64): {}", truncated);
}
```

Output:
```
Original large_amount (u128): 18446744073709551616
Truncated value (u64): 0
```

## Recommendations
1. Add explicit size validation before the conversion:
```rust
if amount > u64::MAX as u128 {
    return Err(BridgeError::AmountTooLarge.into());
}
```
